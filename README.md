# Coffee Machine
It's a small project like a virtual coffee machine and how it work.
The goal of this project is to practice on my python programming sckill, and have fun.
You can order a coffee by answering this question : ‚ÄãWhat would you like? (espresso/latte/cappuccino):‚Äã ‚Äù
but don't think that it's free! you have to pay for the coffee!(not really üòÅ)
here the menu:


MENU = {
    "espresso": {
        "ingredients": {
            "water": 50,
            "coffee": 18,
            "milk": 0,
        },
        "cost": 1.5,
    },
    "latte": {
        "ingredients": {
            "water": 200,
            "milk": 150,
            "coffee": 24,
        },
        "cost": 2.5,
    },
    "cappuccino": {
        "ingredients": {
            "water": 250,
            "milk": 100,
            "coffee": 24,
        },
        "cost": 3.0,
    }
}
